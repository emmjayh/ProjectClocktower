# Blood on the Clocktower Storyteller Mechanics: Complete Implementation Guide

## 1. Exact Order of Operations for Storyteller Actions

### Pre-Game Setup Sequence
The official order of operations follows a strict sequence to ensure proper game initialization:

1. **Physical Setup**: Arrange chairs in a circle with a gap for storyteller entry, place Town Square board in center
2. **Grimoire Preparation**: Assemble with metal clips and stand, position to prevent player visibility
3. **Edition Selection**: Choose appropriate edition (Trouble Brewing 5+, Bad Moon Rising/Sects & Violets 7+)
4. **Character Selection**: Secretly choose characters following player count distribution rules
5. **Character Modifications**: Process orange leaf setup abilities (add/remove characters as specified)
6. **Token Distribution**: Shuffle character tokens in bag, pass clockwise for drawing
7. **Grimoire Organization**: Arrange tokens matching seating order

### Night Phase Order
**First Night** (7+ players):
1. All players close eyes
2. Minion information phase (wake all Minions, show Demon)
3. Demon information phase (show Minions and 3 not-in-play good characters)
4. Character abilities in night sheet order
5. Dawn announcement

**Other Nights**:
1. All players close eyes
2. Dusk actions (if Travelers present)
3. Character abilities in night sheet order
4. Dawn announcement

## 2. Night Phase Procedures and Timing

### Silent Communication Protocol
The storyteller uses standardized hand signals exclusively:
- **Wake player**: 2 taps on shoulder/knee
- **Eyes closed**: Hand over own eyes
- **Yes/No**: Nod/shake head
- **Good/Evil**: Thumbs up/down
- **Numbers**: Fingers (thumb-to-fingertips for zero)
- **Player selection**: Point directly
- **Character reveal**: Show token close to player

### Timing Guidelines
- Allow 5-10 seconds for player decisions
- Don't rush confused players - guide with head movements
- Wake players immediately when abilities trigger
- Abilities work instantly (death stops abilities immediately)
- Character ability text overrides night sheet order when conflicts arise

### Complex Night Interactions
When multiple characters interact, follow these principles:
- Process death triggers immediately (e.g., Ravenkeeper wakes immediately upon death)
- Persistent effects end when source dies/becomes drunk
- Track incomplete actions with reminder tokens
- Handle forgotten actions by either resetting all players or resolving privately

## 3. Day Phase Management Rules

### Day Phase Structure
1. **Dawn**: Players open eyes, deaths announced
2. **Discussion**: Free conversation (public or private)
3. **Nominations**: Called after 5-10 minutes
4. **Voting**: Sequential on each nomination
5. **Execution**: Highest vote meeting threshold
6. **Transition**: Move to night phase

### Discussion Management
- Core rule: "You may say whatever you want at any time"
- Encourage both public and private conversations
- Give shy players the floor when nominated
- Never demand players speak
- Discourage character discussion before first night

### Nomination Rules
- Only alive players may nominate
- Each player may nominate once per day
- Each player may be nominated once per day
- Maximum one execution per day
- Give "last call" warning before closing nominations

## 4. Information Distribution Mechanics

### Core Information Principles
- **Secrets are secret**: Only reveal what abilities specifically grant
- **Drunk/poisoned flexibility**: Can give false information to affected players
- **Timing crucial**: Information given when abilities trigger
- **Never reveal**: How players died, drunk/poisoned status, others' character changes

### Information Token Usage
- **Character tokens**: Show specific identities when required
- **Info tokens**: Use standardized tokens ("YOU ARE", "These are your Minions")
- **Reminder tokens**: Track ongoing effects (turn upside-down for drunk/poisoned)
- **Night tokens**: Guide proper wake order

### Drunk/Poisoned Information
- Wake affected players normally and go through motions
- Generally give misleading information
- Support evil team bluffs through false information
- Can occasionally give correct information for game balance
- "Once per game" abilities used while drunk/poisoned are lost permanently

## 5. Character Abilities and Interactions

### Ability Resolution Principles
1. **Ability text trumps night sheet**: Token text is authoritative
2. **Immediate effects**: Abilities work instantly when triggered
3. **Death timing**: Characters lose abilities immediately upon death
4. **Storyteller decides**: When ability doesn't say "choose", storyteller decides
5. **Square brackets ignored**: [Setup text] has no effect mid-game

### Common Character Protocols
**Information Characters**:
- Librarian/Investigator: Choose players and character based on game needs
- Empath: Show finger count for neighbor alignments
- Fortune Teller: Give yes/no demon answers for chosen pair

**Protective Characters**:
- Monk: Target can't choose themselves
- Soldier: Immune to Demon ability but not execution
- Mayor: Can redirect Demon attacks

**Evil Characters**:
- Demon receives 3 not-in-play good characters for bluffing
- Spy can register as good/specific good type
- Recluse can register as evil/specific evil type

## 6. Voting and Execution Procedures

### Standard Voting Process
1. Announce "Votes for [Player], starting now"
2. Point at nominee and extend arm
3. Move hand clockwise around circle
4. Count votes aloud: "1... 2... 3..."
5. Start with nominee, go clockwise
6. Hand up = vote, hand down = no vote

### Execution Requirements
- Minimum 50% of living players must vote
- Highest vote count wins (must meet threshold)
- Ties = no execution
- Players may vote multiple times per day
- Dead players have one ghost vote for entire game

### Special Voting Mechanics
- **Butler**: Can only vote if Master votes
- **Mayor**: If 3 alive and no execution, good wins
- **Organ Grinder**: All vote with eyes closed, count silently
- **Bureaucrat**: Chosen player's vote counts as 3
- **Voudon**: Only dead players and Voudon can vote

## 7. Win Condition Verification

### Good Team Victory
- **Primary**: Demon dies (immediate victory)
- **Mayor exception**: 3 players alive at day end with no execution
- **Special losses**: Saint execution causes good loss

### Evil Team Victory
- **Primary**: Only 2 non-Traveler players remain alive
- **Immediate declaration**: If all remaining players are evil
- **Special wins**: Executing good-aligned Evil Twin

### Verification Process
1. Check if either condition is met after each death
2. Consider protective abilities before declaring victory
3. Remember Travelers don't count for evil win condition
4. Verify no possible path for losing team before ending

## 8. Game Modes and Protocols

### Standard Mode (7-20 players)
- Full character roster available
- Demon gets 3 bluffs
- Evil team knows each other
- Standard character distribution by player count

### Teensyville Mode (5-6 players)
- Only 11 characters on sheet
- No demon bluffs provided initially
- Evil team doesn't know each other
- Creates role reversal dynamic
- Can add Toymaker fabled to restore standard evil mechanics

### Custom Scripts
- Use official script tool for character combinations
- Consider balance carefully when mixing editions
- Fabled characters help balance unusual combinations

## 9. Common Storyteller Mistakes to Avoid

### Critical Errors
1. **Never break core rules** for excitement or balance
2. **Don't compensate** for mistakes by helping opposite team
3. **Avoid strategy advice** - let players make own decisions
4. **Don't reveal information** accidentally through public answers
5. **Never rush** night phases - take time to be accurate

### Procedural Mistakes
- **Forgotten wake-ups**: Create systematic checklist, handle privately if missed
- **Information errors**: Double-check grimoire before giving information
- **Timing rushes**: Relax and be methodical
- **Vote miscounts**: Always verify threshold calculations

## 10. Advanced Techniques and Best Practices

### Game Balance Management
- **Aim for final day drama** with 3-4 players alive
- **Help weaker team subtly** through information choices
- **Support evil bluffs** through consistent storytelling
- **Balance information** to ensure both teams have paths to victory

### Advanced Interaction Handling
- **Make clear rulings** on edge cases and inform players
- **Mirror movements** for fake abilities to support bluffs
- **Use storyteller discretion** for unclear interactions
- **Maintain consistency** throughout the game

### Player Management
- **Shy players**: Give floor periodically, ask if they wish to speak
- **Dominant players**: Manage without singling out
- **New players**: Focus on confidence over competence

### AI Implementation Considerations
**State Tracking Requirements**:
- Track alive/dead, drunk/sober, poisoned/healthy status
- Monitor all reminder tokens and persistent effects
- Maintain night order queue and current position
- Track once-per-game ability usage

**Decision Points**:
- When to give false information to drunk/poisoned players

- Which information to reveal and timing
- Edge case resolution and character interactions

**Error Handling**:
- Ability text always overrides night sheet
- Make clear rulings when uncertain
- Handle unexpected ability triggers
- Prioritize game balance and player experience
